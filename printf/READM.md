## 💡 About the project

> The printf project involves implementing a custom version of the standard C library function printf. This function provides formatted output, which is essential for displaying data in a controlled and user-friendly manner. The goal of the project is to mimic the behavior of the original printf function, understanding its internals, and managing its formatting capabilities.


## 🌟 Features of the Project

- Supports various format specifiers, including:
	- `%c`: Print a single character.
	- `%s`: Print a string of characters.
	- `%p`: Print a memory address.
	- `%d`/`%i`: Print an integer in decimal.
	- `%u`: Print an unsigned integer.
	- `%x`/`%X`: Print a number in hexadecimal (lowercase/uppercase).
	- `%%`: Print a percentage sign.
- Handles flags like -, 0, ., and width/precision for formatting output.
- Modular and reusable code structure to simplify the addition of new specifiers or flags.
- Efficient memory management, ensuring no memory leaks during execution.


## 🛠️ Requirements

The function is written in C language and thus needs the **`gcc` compiler** and some standard **C libraries** to run.

## 🔧 Instructions

**1. Compiling the library**

To compile, go to the library path and run:

```shell
$ make
```

Other make-files-commands:
```shell
$ make bonus
$ make clean
$ make fclean
$ make re
```
**2. Using it in your code**

To use the library functions in your code, simply include its header:

```C
#include "ft_printf.h"
```

## 🎯 Learning Goals
- This project helps develop:
	- Low-level programming skills: Gain deeper knowledge of how functions like printf handle arguments using va_list and variable argument functions (stdarg.h).
	- String manipulation: Master techniques for formatting and processing strings.
	- Algorithm design: Create efficient solutions for implementing custom flags and specifiers.
	- Code optimization: Write clean, modular, and performance-optimized C code.
