## 💡 About the project

> This project is about understanding the way these functions work,
implementing and learning to use them. Your will create your own library. It will be
helpful since you will use it in your next C school assignments.

## 🛠️ Usage

### Requirements

The function is written in C language and thus needs the **`gcc` compiler** and some standard **C libraries** to run.

### Instructions

**1. Compiling the library**

To compile, go to the library path and run:

```shell
$ make
```

Other make-files-commands:
```shell
$ make bonus 
$ make clean 
$ make fclean
$ make re 
```
**2. Using it in your code**

To use the library functions in your code, simply include its header:

```C
#include "libft.h"
```

## 📋 Testing
